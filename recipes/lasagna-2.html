    <p>A lasagna made of pork.</p>    

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground pork</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (28-to 32-ounce) can whole tomatoes in juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano, crumbled </li>
        <li>12 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh mozzarella balls, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.</li><br>
        <li>In a large heavy pot, heat the olive oil over medium high heat until hot then stir in the onion, carrot, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 6 minutes. Stir in the pork, breaking up the lumps of pork with a spatula and cook, until browned, about 6 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes with their juice and the oregano, and boil, breaking up the tomatoes with a spatula until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li><br>
        <li>In a 3-to 3 1/2-quart lasagna dish spread 1 cup of the sauce over the bottom. Place 3 lasagna noodles evenly over the sauce, leaving even space between the noodles. Top the noodle layer evenly with a layer of sauce, then place another 3 noodles on top. Spread an even layer of sauce over the noodles, then dollop half the ricotta and half the mozzarella. Top with another layer of 3 noodles, then sauce, then the remaining 3 noodles and sauce. Dollop with the remaining ricotta and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella.</li><br>
        <li>Cover the lasagna dish with aluminum foil and bake until the filling is bubbling, about 45 minutes. Uncover the dish and continue to bake until the cheese is browned in places, about 30 minutes more. Let the lasagna stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
